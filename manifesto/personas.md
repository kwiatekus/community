# Kyma Personas

The following personas are fictional characters that we defined in order to represent the different types of users that might use Kyma. Keep these personas in mind when contributing to Kyma as they will help you to understand Kyma users' needs and goals (GAINS :green_heart:) and major pain points (PAINS :broken_heart:).

### GAINS

- :green_heart: I want to write my Kubernetes application using my favorite IDE and store it in GitHub.
- :green_heart: I want to build Kubernetes applications in any language, really fast.
- :green_heart: I need a thin "multi-cloud" runtime for my application.
- :green_heart: I need a super easy, automated deployment directly from my application's source code.
- :green_heart: Help me understand Kyma API.

### PAINS

- :broken_heart: I hate doing backward engineering in order to understand how things work together.
- :broken_heart: Don't make me use code editors on the web.
- :broken_heart: I don't want to be locked with any tools. Let me replace or completely opt out of any of the preconfigured components.
- :broken_heart: I hate tons of configuration.

### GAINS

- :green_heart: I need to evaluate Kyma fast (within 1 day).
- :green_heart: I love tutorials, sample code, recipes that refer to my use cases (i.e authentication/authorization flows).
- :green_heart: I want to ensure product (industry) standards for free (i.e security, accessibility, observability, tracing, etc).
- :green_heart: I want a futureproof platform, based on references.
- :green_heart: With Kyma, I want to connect to systems I know (public and internal ones).
- :green_heart: I need a trial version of Kyma before I can recommend it.
- :green_heart: I need agility in architecture design. I want to replace individual modules if needed.
- :green_heart: I want a painless upgrade path.
- :green_heart: I want operational support.

### PAINS

- :broken_heart: I give up on a project if success stories and/or references are missing.
- :broken_heart: I give up on a project if documentation (incl. tutorials) is missing.
- :broken_heart: I don't want to take extra care about security/monitoring/tracing...
